## 🚀 Core Capabilities

*   **Deep Performance Analysis**: Calculate CAGR, Absolute Growth, and Multiplier across multiple time horizons (1Y, 3Y, 5Y, 10Y, Max).
*   **Risk & Efficiency**: Compute advanced risk-adjusted metrics like **Sharpe Ratio**, **Sortino Ratio**, **Calmar Ratio**, and **Omega Ratio**.
*   **Market Character**: Identify fund style using **Beta**, **Jensen's Alpha**, and **Information Ratio** against benchmarks (Nifty 50, Nifty 500).
*   **Capture Dynamics**: Analyze **Upside & Downside Capture Ratios** to understand how the fund behaves in varying market conditions.
*   **Rolling Returns**: Generate detailed rolling return profiles illustrating the probability of beating bank FDs and the frequency of negative returns.
*   **Consistency Metrics**: Measure trend intensity with the **Hurst Exponent (H)** and calculate **Batting Average** for outperformance frequency.

### Technical Stack
*   **Frontend**: [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) for a reactive, data-driven user interface.
*   **Visualization**: [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) for interactive, publication-quality financial charts.
*   **Analytics Engine**: [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), and [SciPy](https://scipy.org/) for vectorized financial computations.
*   **Data Layer**: Custom robust integration with **AMFI API** (`mfapi.in`) with browser-mimicking headers and **yfinance** for index benchmarks.
*   **Persistence**: Built-in local file-based caching in `data/cache/` to minimize API latency and handle throttling.
*   **Observability**: Integrated **Structured Logging** for tracking API status, cache hits/misses, and error diagnostics.
*   **Type Integrity**: Enforced **Static Type Hinting** with **Mypy**, ensuring data types across the financial engine are validated before execution.
*   **Dependency Governance**: Uses **`uv`** for deterministic builds with a high-security `uv.lock` file, preventing "dependency drift."

## 📦 Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone & Initialize
```bash
git clone https://github.com/convexica/india-fund-analytics.git
cd india-fund-analytics
python -m venv venv
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Professional installations can use **`uv`** (recommended) for perfect reproducibility, or standard `pip`:
```bash
# Institutional Standard (Perfectly reproducible)
uv sync

# Legacy Standard (Standard install)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Setup Automation (Optional)
If you plan to run the keep-alive script or automated tests:
```bash
playwright install chromium
```

### 4. Run the Dashboard
```bash
streamlit run app/main.py
```

## ⚙️ Deployment & Quality Assurance

*   **Deployment**: Hosted on **Streamlit Cloud**.
*   **CI/CD**: Uses **GitHub Actions** for the **"CI Guardian"** workflow:
    *   **Linter**: Fast style checking with **Ruff**.
    *   **Type Guard**: Strict static analysis with **Mypy**.
    *   **Unit Tests**: Automated financial validation with **Pytest**.
*   **Automation**: A scheduled workflow runs every 6 hours using **Playwright** to prevent the instance from entering "sleep mode" on the free tier.
*   **Sustainability**: Managed by **Dependabot** to keep dependencies secure and up-to-date with zero-effort maintenance.
